# Exercise 1

The `here()` command tells you the root directory of your R project. You can use this to locate to the directory you want from your root directory, by something like:

`here("directory_you_want_parent","directory_you_want1")`. 

The advantage of `here()` over relative path is that it does not matter in which directory you are working at, whether you are in the root directory or at a child directory.

This makes calling functions/reading/writing/ from other directories easier since you won't have to do something like:

`read_csv(../../directory_you_want1/dat.csv)`,

but can do 

`read_csv(here(directory_you_want_parent/directory_you_want1/dat.csv))`.

This function is robust in this sense that as long as you are working within the root project directory and know the path you want, you can access in a consistent way.

# Exercise 2

## Drop factor / levels;

Before dropping `Oceania` continent, we first check if `contient` is a factor. 

```{r}
# check the class of continent
(gapminder$continent %>% 
  class() )

# how many levels?
(gapminder$continent %>% 
   nlevels())

# levels?
(gapminder$continent %>% 
   levels()) 

# number of rows in the data
(gapminder_rownum<-nrow(gapminder))
```

We now drop `Oceania` and unnecessary factor levels.

```{r}
# Filter oceania
filter_gap <- gapminder %>%
  filter(continent != "Oceania")

# Drop unused factors (continents)
gap <- filter_gap %>%
  droplevels() 

```

Now after dropping `Oceania` we check that the of levels is decreased to 4, and check the levels. Of course, the total number of rows decreased as well
```{r}
# how many levels?
(gap$continent %>%
  nlevels)

# levels?
(gap$continent %>% 
  levels)

#number of rows in the data
((gap_rownum <-nrow(gap)))
```

## Reorder levels based on knowledge from data.


**`arrange` on original factor vs. releveled factor.**

Let's `arrange` on the country. Default order follows the alphabetical order of the countries. Let's only look at data in 1997.

```{r}
gap_1997 <-gap %>% 
   filter(year=="1997")

(arr_gap <- gap_1997 %>% 
  arrange(country)) %>% datatable()
```


We will reorder the countries in the order of population (taking the maximum population recorded).

```{r}
# reordered `country` according to population
relevel_country<-
  fct_reorder(gap_1997$country,
              gap_1997$pop,max,
              .incr=TRUE) 
```

```{r}
(arr_re_gap <- gap_1997 %>%
  arrange(relevel_country)) %>%
  datatable()
``` 

We see that relevelling the factors can be very useful when we want to see the entries of the data in a particular order we are interested in (in this case, population).

For visualization, we filter out countries in Europe in 1997. Notice the difference between ordering the countries and not.

```{r}
gap_euro <- gapminder %>% filter(continent=="Europe",year =="1997")
p1<-gap_euro %>% ggplot(aes(x=(country),
              y = pop)) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
  coord_flip()+
  ylab("countries") + 
  xlab("population") +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  ggtitle()

p2<- gap_euro %>% ggplot(aes(y=pop,
             x =fct_reorder(gap_euro$country,
                            gap_euro$pop,
                            max, .incr=TRUE))) +
  geom_bar(stat="identity") + 
  coord_flip() + 
  ylab("countries") + 
  xlab("population") + 
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# plot side by side
grid.arrange(p1,p2,ncol=2)
```


# Exercise 3: File I/O

We will write and read to/from csv. The data that we will write to csv is:

```{r}
(cont_pop <- gapminder %>%
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarise(avg_pop = mean(pop))) %>%
  kable()
```

Saving this `cont_pop` on disk:
```{r}
write_csv(cont_pop,
          here::here("hw5","exported_file.csv"))
```

```{r}
(imp_cont_pop <-
   read_csv(here::here("hw5",
                       "exported_file.csv"))) %>% 
  kable()
```

We find that the class of the `continent` is now `character` instead of factor. We convert it back to a factor.
```{r}
# First convert it to tibble
imp_cont_pop <- as_tibble(imp_cont_pop)
imp_cont_pop$continent %>%
  class()

# convert back to factor
imp_cont_pop$continent <- factor(imp_cont_pop$continent)

imp_cont_pop$continent %>% 
  class()
```

Now we order the dataset `imp_cont_pop` according to the population size.
 
 
```{r}
(ordered_dat <- imp_cont_pop %>% 
  arrange(avg_pop)) %>% kable()
```

# Exercise 4 : Visualization design

In Homework 3, I plotted the count of life expectancies across all the countries in the dataset, using histogram with:
  - Many bins (50).
  - A color palette, varying with respect to the count number. I thought this was a good idea, but turns out that it is distracting.
  - No proper x-axis label and no title.


```{r}

q1 <-gapminder %>%
  ggplot(aes(lifeExp, color = lifeExp)) +
  geom_histogram(bins = 50, aes(fill=..count..)) +
  scale_fill_distiller(palette = "Greens")


q2<- gapminder %>%
  ggplot(aes(lifeExp)) +
  geom_density(fill="dark green") +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab("Age (years)") +
  ggtitle("World-wide count of life expectancies")

# plot side by side
(q3<-grid.arrange(q1,q2,ncol=2))

```

Now, instead of a histogram, I used a density plot. Density plot is a continuous version of the histogram. Notice that:
  - Instead of count on the y-axis, it shows the probability density function of the variable `lifeExp`.
  - Using many bins in a histogram smoothes the plot. `geom_density` allows me to easily take the limit of the number of bins.
  - A uniform color that is not distracting.
  - The axis labels are added.
  
  
# Exercise 5 Saving figure

The last plot is `q3`, but we pass in the argument for `plot` anyways. If I wanted to save `p2` instead, passing in the argument `p2` is necessary.

```{r}
ggsave(here::here("hw5","plot_comparison.png"),
       plot=q3,width=15,height=15,dpi=300)
```

```{r}
ggsave(here::here("hw5","europe_pop.png"),
       plot=p2,width=15,height=15,dpi=300)
```

Notice that the text size is tiny. To resolve this, I would have to go back and change the font sizes in the figures. But for the purpose of this assignment, I will skip this.
