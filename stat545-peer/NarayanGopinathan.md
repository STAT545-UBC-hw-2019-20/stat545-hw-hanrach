Remarks:

- You did not generate pdf or markdown (the knitted product) to make it easier to read, but you know how to create a RMarkdown. 
- Good use of basic R functions to present data in different ways. Nice plot. 
- Perhaps you could use the tibble function and explain the advantages of using it. 
- I did not know that in wikipedia, the url formatting is different! Very cool.
